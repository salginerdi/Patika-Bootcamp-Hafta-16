    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
        Hi, I'm Erdi Salgın. This is my first web page that I developed with HTML. 
        I learnt Java as a backend language before, my next goal is to become a Full Stack Web Developer by learning HTML, CSS, 
        JavaScript and React. Apart from coding, I am interested in music and I perform with my own band as a vocalist. That's all I 
        have to say about myself for now.
    </p>
    <h2>My Favourite Music Groups</h2>
