    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Erdi Salgın. This is my first web page that I developed with HTML.
      I learnt Java as a backend language before, my next goal is to become a
      Full Stack Web Developer by learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.
      Apart from coding, I am interested in music and I perform with my own band
      as a vocalist. That's all I have to say about myself for now.
    </p>

    <p>
      Red Hot Chili Peppers (RHCP), formed in 1983, is an American band that
      blends funk, punk and metal. The founders of the band are Anthony Kiedis,
      Michael Balzary, Hillel Slovak and Jack Irons.

      Their first name was 'Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of
      Mayhem' and the band signed a contract with EMI record label at the end of
      the same year. They later changed their name to Red Hot Chili Peppers.
